				<h1>Code a Smile  is an online Site.In day-to-day life there are various scenarios where you need to help others, especially when you are travelling, and people beg you for money. But a lot of social crimes are happening behind this. In order to solve that problem, we are introducing a mechanism where we could create a temporary code which can be shared with the person who is in need. So they could directly approach the restaurants nearby and obtain a meal. The validity of the code is 24 hours.This system is implemented as a website which is made using Wix framework and Firebase cloud is used for hosting this service.This work reduces the chances of misusing the money given with the intention to help others and also minimize the chances of robbery during handing over the money. This mechanism can be also implemented in various other situations where directly handing over the money is not possible</h1>
